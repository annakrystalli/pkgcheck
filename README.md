Plumber API to report on package structure and function. Uses
functionality provided by the [`r-lib/pkgapi`
package](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgapi), which is not on CRAN and must
first be installed with

``` r
source("https://install-github.me/r-lib/pkgapi")
```

(or `remotes::install_github()` will also work).
